# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Jannes
Minute taker: Samuel

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda is submitted correctly and on time. Also, it follows the provided template, which is a good thing. However, each topic can be further described and more structured. In addition, please add a time estimate for each topic each time you create an agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

I added this feedback already in week2-feedback on Gitlab. I will give the feedback on the notes for this meeting in next meeting's feedback, due to this template change.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair successfully coordinated the meeting and proposed the topics at the appropriate moment. All topics contained in the agenda were covered. Good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I like that everyone is involved in the meeting and showcases their ideas. All opinions and proposals were taken into account and the discussion was held in a professional manner. I also noticed that you are very honest with each other about your knowledge, progress and concerns, which is great and will help you throughout the course. Great job!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Please start coding. From next week onward, you need to present everything you have submitted on the main branch in order to evaluate your progress.
Regarding **process** , research how branches are supposed to work: having a branch for every issue (not one per person), creating a branch from an issue, creating a development branch, etc. Please also learn how to write commits (the verb needs to be in the infinitive form, i.e. "Add a button ...", not "Adding a button ..."). All this information is widely available on the web, so just search up some of these basics and implement them with your team.
Please work with issues and document everything in those issues. Each issue should to contain (at least) 3 parts: Description, Definition of Done based on the backlog/acceptance criteria, Checklist with subtasks for this issue (the subtasks can be implementation specific). You can also search up how to integrate an issue template in Gitlab so you don't need to manually write this template for every issue.
