# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file was submitted correctly.


### General

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Overall, the Code of Conduct contains correct and clearly described information, without unnecessary additions. Though, there are some sections that could use some improvement regarding the level of details.


### Assignment Description

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The information is correct and concise, written in a professional manner.

### Products

Mark: Good

Feedback: This section is good, but misses the purpose of your application: what are you actually implementing? Also, please write the channel names with capital letters :).

### Planning

Mark: Good

Feedback: This section is good and well formulated, but it's quite unrealistic to meet in person at every submission. Instead, you can assign people each week that are responsible for the deliverables. Also, you can explain more clearly what these "strikes" mean (i.e. what happens at 3 strikes?). 

### Communication

Mark: Good

Feedback: The section is good, clear and concise. However, I would add a bit more details on what will be sent on these channels exactly (e.g. documents, notifications, etc.). Mattermost is for updates/questions for the TA, so no video calls unfortunately :).


### Commitment

Mark: Good

Feedback: This section lacks some details/quantifiable measures. How do you "measure" these expectations that each team member has? Also, please reformat the minute-taker and chair subsections, since they are not very readable now.


### Division of Tasks and Roles

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The information is clear and a schedule for the next meetings is provided. Great job! For the following weeks, please remember that this schedule should also be reflected in Gitlab (e.g. through issues related to the agenda).

### Meetings
  
Mark: Excellent

Feedback: This section is clear and concise, contains clear agreements and dates. It also contains some information about coordonating the TA meetings, which is great. Well done guys!

### Decision Making

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The agreements are clear and realistic. You may consider how will you incorporate the TA suggestions/feedback in making a decision.

### Dealing with Conflicts

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: This section lacks detail. For example, you can discuss what to do in case the conflict escaladates and how/when to involve the TA.

### Guidance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The expectations are realistic, but they are not clear enough and lack some details. It is not specified what type of the content feedback you want, since it depends whether I am allowed to actually give you that feedback or not. For example, for the assignments, I am allowed to give you feedback if you ask for it, but for the code, I cannot give you any suggestions.

### Consequences

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: This 3-strike system is indeed a good idea :). You can maybe discuss a bit about what to do in case something that is unexpected happens (an "other" case for exceptional situations that you did not think about).

### Success Factors

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The forgiving word choice was actually touching :). Nice success factors, I really see them as a good fit for your team.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Good

Feedback: The criteria you have selected are good and quantifiable. However, an explanation on WHY these are important to the team will be a great addition to this section.
