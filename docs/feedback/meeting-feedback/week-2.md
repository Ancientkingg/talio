## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Danylo
- **Notetaker**: Rafayel

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Both a chair and a minute taker were selected, which is great. Good job!

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember that it is MANDATORY to rotate roles every week. So every person needs to be the chairman at least ONCE.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was coherent and followed the provided template. The topics were clearly described and showcased your concerns and discussion points for this week.

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember to add this document to the repository prior to every meeting so I can have access to it and check its contents beforehand.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair coordinated the meeting and presented the main points successfully. Also, there was enough time allowed for each of the team members to expose their ideas regarding every topic.

#### Time management

Mark: Good

Feedback: The topics were all covered extensively, which is great. However, for the next meetings please try to come up with more questions/topics beforehand. The agenda topics were mostly finished in the first 20 minutes, which is not necessarily benefic considering this is your opportunity to ask as many questions as possible. Also, take into account that your TA meetings are time bounded, so working on the assignments during this meeting and not in extra meetings is not necessarily productive.

Reminder for next meetings: I can only give you feedback on the assignments (prior to the deadline) if you REQUEST it yourselves.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes are clear and useful for the team. I also appreciated that, along with fulfilling the notetaking role, the minute taker was also involved in the discussion and presented their ideas/concerns.

Reminder for next meetings: Please keep in mind to upload the notes right after every meeting on the repository and to write them down in the agenda (i.e. the agenda will be uploaded 2 times, one before the meeting with the topics and one after the meeting with the complete notes).

#### Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I've noticed you are continuing to improve your team bond and get along really well. You listen to each other's opinions and treat each other with respect. You also give each other feedback and suggestions in a peaceful, proffesional manner. In addition, I think it's very good that the level of communication is equal for everybody, independent of their meeting roles (chair/notetaker). Great job so far!
