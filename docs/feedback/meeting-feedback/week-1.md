## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

I've noticed that, during the Product discussion, everybody was involved and tried to showcase their ideas.
You all seem to be excited in this course and are interested in your team members's opinions.
This shows that you are already starting to create a bond as a team based on mutual trust and respect, which is very important throughout the course.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Your excitement helped you to successfully moderate the discussion and not be dependent on my input, which helps bulding your team bond.
Regarding the discussion flow, I think that you sometimes get lost in the topic and spend too much time on it, which is not necessarily productive since the meetings are time bounded.
For the next meetings, I suggest you to have a more clear view about the topics that need to be covered and assign a timeframe for each of them.
In the teamwork lecture, you will receive more guidelines on how to coordinate and structure your meetings, so pay attention to them in order to improve your meeting productivity :).
