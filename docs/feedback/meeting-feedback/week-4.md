# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Rafayel
Minute taker: Tejas

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
> The agenda follows the provided template and was added to the repository in time.

> However, I would like to see a bit more structure regarding the points of action: instead of nested bullet points, having subtitles for each topic and then bullet points for the subtasks/questions can make the agenda more readable.

> Another point to consider is the naming of the files. It's not necessary, but you would make my life a bit easier if you write the actual week instad of the date for the agendas.
