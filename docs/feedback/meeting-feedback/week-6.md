# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Samuel
Minute taker: Danylo

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
> The agenda follows the template and was added on time. It has coherent points and everything is clearly detailed with subtasks. 

>However, for the next meetings, I think you should try to come up with more topics, since the agenda is quite short and I think it won't cover the full timeslot.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Previous minute taker: Tejas

Feedback: 
> The notes are coherent and detailed enough, you seem to have captured every important topic that was discussed during the meeting. Great job!

> For the future meetings, you can try to mark the notes in a different way (maybe write them in italic?) so that they don't get mixed up with the subtasks and topics that were contained initially in the agenda.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
> The chair successfully coordinated the meeting and ensured all topics were covered. Good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
> Everybody is sharing their opinions freely during the meeting. I like that you are all open to the other teammates' ideas, which is great.

> I also like that you continue approaching the whole project with enthusiasm and determination.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:
> The workload seems to be evenly divided, which is good. The app looks neat and it's clear that you put in a lot of effort to write quality code.

> However, you are a bit behind track with the overall progress. Please try to finish the basic requirements until next week.
