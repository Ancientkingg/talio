### Backlog

Hi! Just a note before you read the feedback and start panicking. This feedback is purely constructive (since it's only a draft) and will help you in getting a good grade for the final version of the backlog. Please read it **carefully** and adjust **everything** (or almost everything) I mentioned below. This is standardized feedback, meaning it's based on a clear rubric and I am pointing out all the things you miss from that rubric, thus it may come off as a bit harsh. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them during the TA Meeting. :)

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file is correctly submitted. For this assignment, a PDF document would be more suited, since it's easier to add images (e.g. mockups). Thus, you can try converting this .md file into an Overleaf document for example :).

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Overall, the backlog follows the recommended structure, which is a great thing. However, the basic and advanced features should not be listed like this. Instead, **the epics must be constructed based on them**.
Moreover, although the information is detailed, it contains quite a lot of unecessary information. I understand this "confused user"/"realistic situation" vibe, but it doesn't really suit the purpose of a backlog. You should aim for clear and measurable information that indicates clearly when a user story is finished.
Also, if you have enough time, consider adding some mock-ups for your epics.

### Epics

Mark: Insufficient (PLEASE ADJUST IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: The backlog should first of all contain an epic for a "minimal app", as stated on the website. In your epics, seem to have combined both basic and advanced features, which affects the priority in which the user stories are implemented. Please regroup the user stories in different epics, based on the "minimal app" epic and the priority of the advanced features that you have mentioned in the backlog.
Epics should also have a description that clarify the feature, again as stated on the course website. Make sure to add this.

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: Most of the user stories follow the required format and have a clear focus on the user perspective. After modifying the stories for coherence purposes (which I will mention in the Acceptance Criteria section), please make sure to keep the format explained on the website: "As *role* want to *requirement* so I can *reason*".
Although very detailed, each user story seems to cover only one particular interaction, which is good.
Since you have no epic description, I couldn't notice any "gaps" of functionality (parts of the app that are not explained), but this might not be true. Please make sure of this yourself before submitting the final version.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient (PLEASE ADJUST IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: Please review the contents of the course website in order to make this backlog. The size of most user stories is large and hard to parse, which is **imperative** to be adjusted. The acceptance criteria is also lacking considering the size of the user stories (also, when adding acceptance criteria, mark it as a sub-bullet of the actual user story for reading purposes).
Regarding clarity, the whole contents of the backlog need to be formulated in a **measurable** way, that allows to decide when a story is done/finished. Thus, go through the backlog one more time and either remove or add more quantifiable descriptions to "uncertain" words like: "easily", "I guess", "more-or-less", etc.
