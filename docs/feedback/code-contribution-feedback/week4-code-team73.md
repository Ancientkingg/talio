# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

Hi! Before the feedback, I want to make you aware of the fact that, in the GitInspect reports, there is a 6th person (?) pushing code: AncientKingg :). I don't know what you did, but one of you is basically pushing code from 2 accounts. Judging by the picture, it seems to be Samuel, but I'm not sure, so please check between yourselves what's happening and fix this.

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: 
> The repository seems to contain a good amount of commits and they seem to only touch upon a specific piece of functionality. However, please be a bit more consistent with the naming: no lowercase letters, same verb tense, etc.
> You can check out this website: https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/, which gives some useful tips for structuring your commits (e.g. using imperative instead of past tense).


#### Isolation

Grade: Good

Feedback: 
> The branches you use successfully isolate individual features, but they are a bit inconsistent in terms of namings. Either decide to work with Gitlab issue branches or make individual branches yourselves locally, but try to be consistent.
> In additionm you don't seem to have a good amount of MRs for this week, since two of the teammates have no MRs. Please aim for at least a MR per person per week.


#### Reviewability

Grade: Good

Feedback:
> The MRs contain a good amount of commits, with related and coherent changes.
> Regarding the MR construction, only some of you add extensive descriptions to their MRs as far as I could tell. Here is an article that can help you understand the value of merge descriptions (and it also has a template, you can check it out and try to adapt it to the project): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-should-write-merge-requests-like-youre-posting-to-instagram-765e32a3ec9c/.


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Excellent

Feedback:
> Overall, there seems to be a great amount of code reviews and the discussion seem to be authentic. Great job!


#### Build Server

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: 
> The builds seem to be very long (>3mins), which is not good. Please make sure to optimize your code a bit/try to find the source of this problem and fix it. 
> In addition, please build the projet locally before you push it, since as of now you have quite frequent pipeline fails.
> On a brighter note, good job for adding coherent and reasonable checkstyle rules!
