\section{Heuristic Issues}

Brief intro and overview of criticisms.

\subsection{Initial Join Server}

One issue that a tester reported was the potential confusion a user might feel when first faced with the "Server Connection" screen. This could be remedied by writing a brief description of what is expected of the user, namely that they input the address of a server hosting talio. Additionally one could briefly mention the option of hosting one's own server, although that would be a little more challenging than simply connecting. One piece of advcie given by a reviewer, which would be a very intuitive way of improving the quality of life, is to have a default server address already in the text box, which would simply connect the user to a default talio hosted server by simply clicking "connect".

Another piece of feedback, was that we need to rigorously error check and throw accoring error messages on the "Server Connection" screen. This was not properly displayed in the prototype, but we were and are indeed planning to check and throw for
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Empty Address
    \item Invalid Address
    \item Server Not Responding
\end{enumerate}
