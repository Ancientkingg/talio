Heuristic Usability Evaluations are done to find problems in user interfaces of applications. This report is about the evaluation we have conducted for our application 'talio.'.  In this report, we describe how we have conducted the evaluation (instructions given to evaluators, format of submitting an evaluation and criteria on the basis of which the application is to be evaluated) - so that the evaluation can be reproduced - and the actual results of the evaluation (the feedback received and how we will act on it to improve the product).
