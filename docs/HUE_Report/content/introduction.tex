\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

During the development process of any application, it is important to carefully consider the user experience and all the possible interactions a given user could have with your project.
Doing so allows for better understanding of the target audience, as well as providing a comprehensive overview of the strengths and flaws of the current iteration of the project.
The Heuristic Usability Evaluation (HUE) report is centred around identifying key areas of improvement within a prototype, with the ultimate goal being to improve the overall usability, appearance and functionality of said prototype in a precise manner.
This is done with the help of a group of experts, which provide an external, non-biased review of the application.
In the context of the given prototype, the HUE will be focused on the user-friendliness of the UI, with an emphasis on key UI pylons such as ``User Control and Freedom'' and ``Recognition rather than Recall''.
The combined feedback for all the covered criteria will serve as the basis for a more comprehensive, unified evaluation.
The prototype being evaluated is a (semi) functional model of talio.
- a sleek and minimal task management application.
The prototype, created with moqups, provides an interactive overview of the main features and scenes featured in the application.
The prototype features minimalistic style language, a black/grey/white color scheme and a simple, non-cluttered UI which presents all the functionality to the user immediately.
