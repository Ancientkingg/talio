\section{Improvements and Conclusions}


\vspace{2mm}

In the initial join server page, we will -
\begin{itemize}
    \item provide a default server address for users to connect to
    \item provide users with the option of hosting their own server
    \item guide users to provide a valid server address with precise and helpful error messages. The cases we have decided on are for when a user does not provide any address or provides an invalid address. In case the server is not responding, this will also be conveyed in a non-technical, user-friendly manner.
\end{itemize}

To the home page, we will
\begin{itemize}
    \item provide a way for users to disconnect from the current server so that they can join another server
    \item We will make it more evident that this page is the dashboard, perhaps by putting such a label at a prominent position near the top of the page.
\end{itemize}

The Board overview was the page with the most features, and also the most reported problems. To fix these, we will
\begin{itemize}
    \item make the board settings easier and more intuitive to find, maybe by making the pencil icon beside it visible at all times instead of just showing it when a mouse hovers over the name of the board.
    \item move the copy board button to the bar at the top of the screen instead of being in the body. We will also make it more easy to identify.
    \item provide cards with both a description and a title, as opposed to just a block of text as they have now.
\end{itemize}
