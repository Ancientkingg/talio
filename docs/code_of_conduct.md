# Code of Conduct

*Team name:* Malicious Koalas

## Shared team values
- Don't be late
- Have respect for the others
- Be honest about your skill level and effort you can put in to the project
- Communication is key
- Don't keep things to yourself
- Use comments in the Code

## Assignment description
We need to work together as a team to plan, produce and deliver a product to a client. We need to
keep each other accountable, evenly distribute the workload and work around each other's
shortcomings in order to produce a high quality product.

## Target or ambition level
It is difficult to quantify what we are working for, but we are all willing to put in maximal effort into
the project. We will target a grade of 9, with aspirations of a 10, as everybody is ready to put in
time and effort. We will attempt all of the requirements for the project and will be actively
communicating as a team in order to ensure a high grade.

## Products
Everything will be placed on gitlab, this way our workflow is standardized. We will
communicate using mattermost and whatsapp, and use gitlab as well as google docs for file
sharing for any written work and collaboration. Whenever anything is finished, the work will be
submitted to gitlab so that everybody has access. The work must meet the checkstyle
standards as well as displaying a general professionalism. To enforce this, we will work with
merge requests rather than pushing.

## Planning
We will implement a 3 strike system based on absences and late submissions, the severity of a
violation will be judged by the entire group in unison. Strikes are handed out by voting (a simple
majority suffices) with the possibility of half-strikes for less severe things. We will enforce a
minimum of 2 reviews on merge requests in order to ensure quality. We will meet in person to
submit the final product.

## Behaviour
Whenever there is a disagreement, we will take time to cool down to have a level head. We will
implement a voting system and will place emphasis on explaining why a certain decision is
made to the other group members. If there are any disagreements, the group will be notified.
If somebody is late: We will discuss the severity of the offense and implement it into the strike
system. Most likely, they will receive a “half-strike”

## Communication
We will communicate on MatterMost using the chat and video call functions. We will use whatsApp
for less formal inquiries. For individual questions between group members, we will also resort to
whatsApp as it is most accessible to all members

## Commitment
Everyone is accountable to set expectations for themselves, we will assess their work against
those expectations. Honesty is key, we must know our strengths and weaknesses as well as our
limits.
Minute Taker - General notes - what we did - what we will discuss next time - what does every
person have to do and by when
Chair - Is the meeting productive and focused? Is the group organized? Is the planning sufficient?
Does everybody know what they are doing?

## Division of tasks and roles
Both Chairman and minute taker changes every meeting - this disperses the workload and
allows everybody to concentrate/ contribute equally.
The chairmen will be picked by alphabetical order of first name, the minute taker will cycle
starting from Rafayel.

1. Danylo
1. Jannes
1. Jens
1. Rafayel
1. Samuel
1. Tejas

## Meetings
We will meet on Tuesday in person (during labs). After our meeting with the TA, we will stay
behind if necessary to collaborate.
We will have a backup call on Thursday.
Thursday - set aside 2 or 3 hours where everybody works at the same time.
Everyone takes a look at the minutes from the previous meeting and does whatever tasks are
assigned to them in preparation to the next meeting.

## Decision-making
We will start by trying to reach consensus - if the situation escalates, we will decide by majority
vote. If it’s a 3-3 vote then we will flip a coin to decide, since if nobody is convinced to pick the
other side both sides would have their own pros and cons and are equally as good most likely.

## Dealing with conflicts
We will meet as a group and let everybody share their opinions on the matter. This will prevent
any individual biases from influencing our judgment.

## Guidance
We want feedback on both the content and collaboration as it will allow us to work better as a
team and also produce a higher quality of work

## Concequences
We will use the strike system to judge any violations. Using the 3-strike system, if
somebody is out, i.e. they have 3 strikes, we will get the TA involved since at that
point the situation is serious enough to be taken out of our hands.

## Success factors
Everyone is on the same page all the time, everybody is kept informed. We stay organized, and plan our work ahead. Everybody knows their role and what is expected of them at all times. We
are open, honest and forgiving.

## Norms and evaluation criteria
1. Set personal criteria for each step - assest against those
1. Gitlab Quickactions, continuous integration
1. Visible effort
1. Specificity in all commits
1. All merges to the main branch should be stable
