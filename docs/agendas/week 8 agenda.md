## Opening

- Everybody has put in a lot of work this week
- Deadline is coming up, keep your heads up. 

## Check-in - How is everyone doing?
- Does anyone have any burning questions/ ideas they are sitting on? Is there anything anyone is completely stuck on. 
- What is everyone's availability this week?
- Does anyone have any remarks before we start?



## Approval of the agenda

Does anyone have any additions to the agenda?

## Approval minutes
Did everyone read the minutes from the previous meeting?



## Points of action

### Agenda-item 1 - General feedback for the product pitch

- Anything specific we should do differently next time?
- How preferred is a live walkthrough, and is it preferred to have all members visible at the same time?
- To what extent can we discuss code - we are told to "show off" anything unique, but should we treat the viewer as somebody with no coding experience? 
- Was the distribution of time okay?

### Agenda-item 2 - Advanced Features / Aesthetics

- Are we assessed on the "aesthetics" of the application? Will having slight changes from the mock ups impact our grade? 
- By how much is our grade lowered when we don't do the advanced features in the correct order? 
- Would it be better to have a super polished main application, or a slightly less polished main application with more advanced features (ie: what is the grade distribution for advanced features?)


### Agenda-item 3 - The last 2 weeks of the course

- How can we prepare for the Q&A? Are we expected to know everything about our code (Members naturally drifted towards client/ server)
- What is the weight of the teamwork self reflection?
- Any other advice?
